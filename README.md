# Constructive DIM
### Abstract
This paper presents a constructive version of the state-of-the-art Divisive Input Modulation algorithm for the unsupervised learning of image components. Nodes are added to the predictive layer dynamically and throughout the learning process on the basis of the reconstruction error calculated by the network. The proposed solution adapts methods from existing constructive algorithms to the negative feedback network architecture employed by the original DIM implementation. The algorithm that has been developed results in similar levels of accuracy, while at the same striving to build the smallest possible network. The conducted work thus represents a significant improvement over the original model in regards to training times and complexity of the neural network.
